              A managed WLAN solution is more than just managing user access, it can comprise the entire lifecycle of WLAN â€“ from designing, engineering, and installing the wireless systems to managing the entire network. Cloud managed Wi-Fi uses a flexible subscription-based payment model to deliver centralized management for authentication of users and network monitoring. Cloud-managed Wi-Fi simplifies the deployment and management of Wi-Fi networks by eliminating the need for on-premises controllers. Cloud based Wi-Fi services is the way forward; the entire WLAN ecosystem is managed remotely by the service provider ensuring a secure, scalable and stress free Wi-Fi network. There are two prevailing models of cloud-managed wireless: One embeds both the wireless controller and network management software in the cloud, and the other puts only the management functions there. Cloud-based WLAN management is sold as a subscription-based service, which offloads the capital and operational expenses.
