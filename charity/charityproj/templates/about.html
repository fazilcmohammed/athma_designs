                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    Helping Hands Charity was founded in 2010 with a simple mission: to provide support and resources to those in need within our community. What started as a small food drive organized by five dedicated individuals has grown into a comprehensive charity organization serving thousands of people annually.
                </p>
                <p class="section-content">
                    Our founders recognized that while many community members wanted to help others in need, there was no centralized organization to coordinate these efforts effectively. By establishing Helping Hands, they created a platform for volunteers, donors, and community partners to work together toward creating meaningful change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, we operate multiple programs across education, food security, healthcare access, and environmental sustainability. Our team consists of both dedicated staff members and hundreds of passionate volunteers who believe in the power of community service and social responsibility.
